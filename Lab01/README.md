## GitHub-Introduction
    GitHub is an online platform where we can store our code, track changes, and work       together with each other using Git.

## Uses of GitHub 

  * Store and Manage Code – You can keep your projects safely online and track all updates using Git.
  * Collaboration – Many developers can work on the same project without messing up each other’s work.
  * Open-Source & Portfolio – You can contribute to public projects and also show your own work to others as a portfolio.

Some important GitHub terms include repository, commit, branch, merge, pull request, fork, clone, push, pull, and issues.
These help you manage versions of your project, work with teammates, and handle project tasks easily.

## Multimedia Fundamentals

  Multimedia is the integration of multiple forms of media such as text, graphics, audio, video, and animation to communicate information or provide interactive experiences.

  A multimedia system is a computer-based system that can store, process, and deliver these media types together.

## Basic Components of Multimedia

- **Text** – Written information, captions, or titles.
- **Graphics / Images** – Pictures, diagrams, or charts (bitmap or vector).
- **Audio** – Sound, music, speech, or effects.
- **Video** – Moving images, often combined with audio.
- **Animation** – Sequential images creating motion (2D or 3D).
- **Interactive Media** – Media that allows user input and control (games, simulations).

## Advantages

- Enhances learning and understanding.
- Makes content engaging and attractive.
- Enables simulation and visualization.
- Supports interactive applications.

## Applications

- **Education** – Online courses, tutorials.
- **Entertainment** – Movies, music, games.
- **Business** – Presentations, marketing, advertisements.
- **Healthcare** – Simulations, patient education.
- **Communication** – Video conferencing, social media.

## Conclusion
  By learning GitHub and its practical uses, we gain the skills needed to manage code efficiently and work better in teams. At the same time, understanding the core principles of Multimedia Systems helps us build a strong foundation for creating and handling different types of media. Together, these topics prepare us with essential technical knowledge that is useful for modern software development and multimedia applications.
