# *Lab : 3*

# *MIDI Note Processing and Algorithmic Music Generation*

---

## *Objectives*

- Print MIDI channels, notes, and their corresponding frequencies.  
- Generate simple beat, harmony, and melody patterns using MIDI notes.  
- Play individual MIDI tracks (.mid files).  
- Convert MIDI tracks into standard audio (.wav) files using Python tools.

## *Background Theory*

### *1. MIDI Standard*

- *MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)* is a communication protocol used to send digital music performance data.  
- It stores musical instructions such as:
  - note_on  
  - note_off  
  - MIDI channel  
  - Velocity  
  - Note number (0–127)
- MIDI Note Numbers map to musical notes.  
  - Example: 60 = Middle C, 69 = A4 (440 Hz)

#### *Frequency Formula*

To convert a MIDI note number n to its frequency: f = 440 × 2^((n - 69) / 12)

### *2. Music Theory (Basic)*

#### *Beat*
- The basic unit of time in a musical composition.

#### *Harmony*
- Two or more notes played together (chords).

#### *Melody*
- A sequential pattern of musical notes forming the main tune.

---

### *3. Python Libraries Used*

#### *Mido*
- For reading, writing, and analyzing MIDI files.

#### *Pygame*
- For playing MIDI files and basic audio handling.

## *Procedure*

1. Import required libraries:

    python
    import mido
    import math
    import pygame
    

2. Load the MIDI file:

    python
    mid = mido.MidiFile("input.mid")
    

3. Iterate and print MIDI messages, channels, and note numbers:

    python
    for msg in mid:
        if msg.type == "note_on":
            print(msg.note, msg.channel)
    

4. Convert MIDI note numbers to frequency:

    python
    def midi_to_freq(n):
        return 440 * (2 ** ((n - 69) / 12))
    

5. Generate:
   - Beat pattern  
   - Harmony (simple triads)  
   - Melody sequence  

6. Save generated tracks as:

    - beat.mid
    - harmony.mid
    - melody.mid

7. Play the MIDI file:

    python
    pygame.mixer.music.load("melody.mid")
    pygame.mixer.music.play()
    

8. Convert MIDI to WAV (if synthesizer or pygame MIDI backend is available).

---

## *Output*

- Printed MIDI:
  - Channels  
  - Notes  
  - Frequencies  

- Generated MIDI tracks:
  - beat.mid
  - harmony.mid
  - melody.mid

- Played audio using Pygame.

- Converted .wav files from MIDI tracks (if tools installed).

## *Conclusion*

This lab explored MIDI processing using Python.  
We extracted MIDI note information, converted notes into frequencies, and generated musical patterns such as beats, harmony, and melody. We also played and converted these MIDI files into standard audio formats. This experiment strengthened understanding of MIDI protocol, basic music theory, and Python-based algorithmic music generation.
